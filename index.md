# Cybersecurity Projects 

Showcasing hands-on projects in cybersecurity, demonstrating expertise in network security, threat analysis, and system optimization. Each project reflects my commitment to safeguarding digital environments through innovative solutions.

## Creating a SOC

> Created a security operations center (SOC) by deploying a security and event manager (SIEM) the monitors and generates alerts for all the devices in my personal home lab. Set up an intelligence feed that sends the SIEM commonly seen and newly found indicators of compromise.
